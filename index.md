## About the meme
* I put 3 images and text for each image to create the cute meme, also I made a **short story** which snoopy liked the one girl and he tells his feeling.
* The **motivation** for this was to show how cute and brave the snoopy is. 
* I used the **panel formats** to create my meme because I thoungt that it is the best way to show and understand what is going on in the story. 
* Snoopy was always one of my favorite character since I was young, so I use snoopy to show off the skills I learnt from the Lectures/Labs.
* my meme is totally **orignal**, meme is usually use funny phrases that spreads from person to person but I wanted make a cute meme so I created a cute story.
* I choose the background color pink so that people easy to see that it is **love story**.
